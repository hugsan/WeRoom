This is the product of a 2nd semester project with topic System Design. 

Finding a place to live can sometimes be a long process, especially in the bigger cities. Therefore, this project 
was made to help connect tenants and landlords in an easy and manageable way.
Being inspired by other rental sites, we came up with a more unique idea, where combining the swiping concept with room rental would play an essential role in the project.
